# KANBAN BOARD

A retro-style **Kanban board** built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**.  
This project lets you organize tasks by different statuses: **Todo**, **In Progress**, and **Done**. You can drag and drop tasks between these columns, and each task has a priority (low, medium, high) with a point system based on the Fibonacci sequence.

## Features 

- **Drag and drop**: Move tasks between columns to update their status.
- **Priority icons**: Tasks are colored based on priority (low, medium, high).
- **Retro-style UI**: Inspired by classic gaming interfaces, with a **Press Start 2P** font.
- **Responsive layout**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile screens.
- **Fetch and update tasks**: Tasks are fetched from a backend and can be updated through API calls.

## Technologies Used üíª

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Adds static types to JavaScript for better reliability.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for fast UI development.
- **Vite**: Next-gen, fast and lean tool for building modern web apps.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your system. If not, you can download them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

## Usage üñ•Ô∏è
- Viewing Tasks: The app displays tasks in three columns: Todo, In Progress, and Done. You can see the task's title, priority, and points.
- Drag and Drop: You can drag tasks from one column to another to update their status.
- Update Task: You can click on a task's title to edit it.
- Priority Indicators: Tasks are color-coded based on priority: <br>
   Low: Blue <br>
   Medium: Yellow <br>
   High: Red <br>
- Points System: Tasks have points associated with them, which follow a Fibonacci sequence (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13). You can increase or     
  decrease the points by clicking the + or - buttons.
