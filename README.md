# KANBAN-BOARD
A retro-style Kanban board built with React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.   This project lets you organize tasks by different statuses: Todo, In Progress, and Done. You can drag and drop tasks between these columns, and each task has a priority (low, medium, high) with a point system based on the Fibonacci sequence.
