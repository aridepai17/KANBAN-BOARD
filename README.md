# Kanban Board 

A retro-style **Kanban board** built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**.  
This project lets you organize tasks by different statuses: **Todo**, **In Progress**, and **Done**. You can drag and drop tasks between these columns, and each task has a priority (low, medium, high) with a point system based on the Fibonacci sequence.

## Features 

- **Drag and drop**: Move tasks between columns to update their status.
- **Priority icons**: Tasks are colored based on priority (low, medium, high).
- **Retro-style UI**: Inspired by classic gaming interfaces, with a **Press Start 2P** font.
- **Responsive layout**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile screens.
- **Fetch and update tasks**: Tasks are fetched from a backend and can be updated through API calls.

## Technologies Used ðŸ’»
